When we install transmission we want it to be able to use the same permissions
as the files on our storage-provided dataset. In my case, my 'media' user has
the uid of 1002. If I run 'id media' on my transmission jail, I can see that
this user is available to the jail.

To do this, ensure that this user is persisted into the jail by using the
command:

id <user>

In my case, the result is:

root@transmission_1:/ # id media
uid=1002(media) gid=1002(media) groups=1002(media)

Thus, I can safely set in my rc.conf in my transmission jail:

transmission_user="media"
transmission_group="media"

This will allow transmission to run with these user permissions, which are
usually sane. If you have already started transmission before, please stop
transmission and then run the following:

find / -user transmission -exec chown media {} \;
find / -group transmission -exec chgrp media {} \;

Once this has been ran you are safe to start the service again.

* NOTE * To change the settings below without transmission overwriting your
* changes, first stop the transmission service. * /NOTE *

In order to have transmission use in-progress and completed dirs for
downloads, edit the settings.json file located at
/var/db/transmission/settings.json. Change the following settings:

"download-dir" - the completed downloads path
"incomplete-dir" - the in-progress path
"incomplete-dir-enabled" - set to true
